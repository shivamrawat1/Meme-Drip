## Inspiration
I like to wear clothes with InsPiRaTiOnAl Quotes. Why not do it with GenAI?

## What it does
You upload a picture -> Select the clothing piece you want to write the Quote on -> Complete the Prompt Template -> Press Generate. 

## How we built it
I used Flask to build the App and used ideogram-v2-turbo model from Replicate API for inpainting and used Hugging Face segformer_b2_clothes model for automatically segmenting the clothes and generating masks for the inpainting task.

## Challenges we ran into

- Had challenges with integrating the masks from the segformer_b2_clothes model with the Replicate API.
- Bad output quality. Utilized Negative prompts to increase output quality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Being able to complete the project on time.

## What we learned
Learnt how to use Hugging Face models and Replicate API's

## What's next for MemeDrip
I want to create my own fine-tuned Inpainting models for creating memes on the clothes.
